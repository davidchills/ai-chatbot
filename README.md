I wanted to make an interface that used the OpenAI API. I used Laravel and VueJS and it came out pretty good. I'm not posting the actual app, because I'm sure someone will run my tokens out real quick.
I might try and add on users and limit it to logged in users, so that I can upload it somewhere. Sure you can just go to the ChatGPT site, it was cool to make.
